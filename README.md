# CloudByte Solutions: Linux SysAdmin Project

A Linux system administration project, built first on a local VM
and later deployed to AWS EC2. The scenario is CloudByte Solutions, a
fictional 12-person startup that needs a properly configured multi-user
Linux server: user accounts, group-based file access, automated backups,
log analysis, and system health reporting.

## Section 1: Server Foundations

Built the core of the server: four groups (`engineering`, `marketing`,
`operations`, `admins`), twelve user accounts, and a directory tree under
`/shared` with group-based access control.

### Groups and users

| Group | Members |
|---|---|
| `engineering` | alice, bob, carol, dave |
| `marketing` | emma, frank, grace |
| `operations` | henry, iris, jack, kate, leo |
| `admins` | kate, leo |

### Directory structure

| Path | Group | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| `/shared/engineering` | engineering | `770` |
| `/shared/marketing` | marketing | `770` |
| `/shared/operations` | operations | `770` |
| `/shared/company-docs` | admins | `775` |
| `/logs/reports` | admins | `775` |

### Verification

`verify-foundations.sh` checks the groups, users, directories and setup
log in one go. Run it on the VM with:

    # Track 1 (Vagrant): repo is mounted at /vagrant
    bash /vagrant/verify-foundations.sh

    # Track 2 (Lima): repo is mounted at /host inside the VM
    bash /host/verify-foundations.sh


## Section 2: File Management and Permissions

Hardened the team folders and added a shared dropbox. Setgid makes team
ownership reliable; the sticky bit makes the dropbox tamper-resistant.
A permissions test report records what was attempted and what happened.

### Updated directory modes

| Path | Owner:Group | Mode | What's special |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/shared/engineering` | `root:engineering` | `2770` | setgid set |
| `/shared/marketing` | `root:marketing` | `2770` | setgid set |
| `/shared/operations` | `root:operations` | `2770` | setgid set |
| `/shared/dropbox` | `root:admins` | `1773` | sticky bit; others can write but not list |

### Verification

`verify-permissions.sh` checks the team folders, the dropbox, the sample
files, and setgid propagation. Run it on the VM with:

    # Track 1 (Vagrant): repo is mounted at /vagrant
    bash /vagrant/verify-permissions.sh

    # Track 2 (Lima): repo is mounted at /host inside the VM
    bash /host/verify-permissions.sh

## Section 3: User Onboarding Automation

Replaced Section 1's manual user-creation work with a single script,
`scripts/onboard-user.sh`, that takes either an interactive prompt or a
CSV of new hires. Strict mode catches failures early, a `create_user`
function carries the four mutating commands, and `--dry-run` lets the
script be exercised without touching real accounts.

### Script flags

| Flag             | Purpose                                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `--csv PATH`     | Read users from a CSV (`username,group,fullname`)         |
| `--dry-run`      | Print intended actions without creating anything          |
| `-h`, `--help`   | Print the Usage block from the script header              |

A sample CSV ships at `data/new-hires.csv` for repeat runs and
idempotency checks.

### Verification

`verify-onboarding.sh` walks the script and the CSV end-to-end and
prints a ✅ or ❌ for each requirement. Run it on the VM with:

    # Track 1 (Vagrant): repo is mounted at /vagrant
    bash /vagrant/verify-onboarding.sh

    # Track 2 (Lima): repo is mounted at /host inside the VM
    bash /host/verify-onboarding.sh

## Section 4: Backup Automation

Built two scheduled scripts to keep the team folders backed up.
`scripts/backup-shared.sh` archives the whole `/shared` tree (excluding the
backup directory itself) into a date-stamped `.tar.gz` under
`/shared/backups`, with a `trap` that removes a partial archive if the
script is interrupted mid-run. `scripts/cleanup-backups.sh` prunes archives
older than seven days, with a `--preview` flag that lists what would go
without deleting anything. Root cron drives both.

### Schedule

| Script                       | Schedule    | Log file                         |
|------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `scripts/backup-shared.sh`   | `0 2 * * *` | `/var/log/cloudbyte-backup.log`  |
| `scripts/cleanup-backups.sh` | `0 3 * * 0` | `/var/log/cloudbyte-cleanup.log` |

### Verification

`verify-backup.sh` walks the backup directory, both scripts, and the
crontab in one go and prints a ✅ or ❌ for each requirement. Run it on
the VM with:

    # Vagrant: repo is mounted at /vagrant
    bash /vagrant/verify-backup.sh

    # Lima: repo is mounted at /host inside the VM
    bash /host/verify-backup.sh

## Section 6: EC2 Deployment

Deployed the CloudByte server to a t3.micro Amazon Linux 2023 EC2 instance.
Rebuilt the four groups, the twelve users (kate and leo dual-grouped into
`admins`), and the full `/shared/` tree from scratch on the new host. Sent the
two existing docs and the three scripts across with `scp`, re-established the
backup and cleanup cron pipeline with EC2-absolute paths, and wrote a reflective
`differences-log.txt` recording what changed between the local VM and the cloud.

Files added this section:
- `verify-ec2.sh`: runs on EC2, checks the whole deployment from scratch.
- `data/cloudbyte-users.csv`: the twelve-staffer production roster.
- `docs/differences-log.txt`: local-VM-versus-EC2 reflection.
