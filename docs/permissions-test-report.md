| kate  | ls /shared/dropbox                                  | allow    | allow    |

## Notes

- Setgid (mode `2770`) makes "which files does the engineering team own?" an
  answerable question. Without it, ownership tracks the creator's primary group
  and the team-level view falls apart.
- The sticky bit (mode `1773`) protects submissions from cross-user deletion.
- Caveat: the dropbox blocks browsing other people's submissions, not reading
  one whose filename you already know. Standard Unix permissions can't close
  that gap on their own; tools beyond the scope of this project would.
