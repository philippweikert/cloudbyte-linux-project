# verify-health.sh: CloudByte Section 8 self-check (runs on EC2).
# Author:  <your name>
# Created: <date>
# Purpose: Test the system-health deliverables: the script is present and
#          runnable, a report exists carrying every section plus ALERTS, the
#          archive directory exists, and the */2 cron entry is in place.
# Usage:   bash verify-health.sh   (run system-health.sh at least once first)
